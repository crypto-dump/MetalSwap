# What is MetalSwap?

- MetalSwap is a decentralized exchange powered by smart contracts on the BNB smart chain where cryptometals can be created and traded. Cryptometals are a group of blockchain-based metals that mimic the price behavior of real-world metals and provide the possibility of transacting anywhere and anytime for traders without the burdens of actually owning metals. The Metal Token(Metal) is minted by MetalSwap project team as the governance token for the MetalSwap community.
